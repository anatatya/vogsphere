# Claim Code Generator

## What is it?

I wrote the original version of this tool for [The Breach](https://breached.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=7&view=findpost&p=30). The version initially provided here has been generalized more thoroughly documented for easier use on other sites, and has since received additional updates.

**Pull requests are welcome** if you have ideas for improvements that you'd like to share. Requests for new features or difficulties with the tool can be submitted for consideration as [issues in this repo](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/claim-code-generator/issues).

A [demo version of the generator](https://rp-magrathea.github.io/claim-code-generator/claim-code-generator.html) is available via this repo.

## What's included?

- `claim-code-generator.html` (required) is the form members will interact with
- `claim-code-generator.js` (required) constructs the claim HTML when members submit the form
- `claim-code-generator.css` (optional) provides bare bones styling for the demo version (and can be built upon for actual use)

For more detailed usage information and tips, see [the wiki](https://github.com/littlelark/magrathea/wiki/Claim-Code-Generator%3A-Getting-Started).
